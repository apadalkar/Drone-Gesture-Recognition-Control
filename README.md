# Drone Gesture Recognition Control

## Project Overview
This application uses a webcam feed to detect hand gestures in real time and translates them into control signals for a drone. It will leverage [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) to track hand landmarks and classify gestures.

## Goals
- **Real-time hand gesture recognition** using a webcam and MediaPipe
- **Gesture-to-command mapping** for drone control
- **Debouncing** to prevent command flickering

## Setup

A requirements.txt file will be provided for easy installation.
